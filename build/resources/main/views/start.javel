If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Lajavel's vast library of documentation, guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.</p>
        <h4 id="whyh2">A Scalable Framework</h4>

In fact, Lajavel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.</p>
